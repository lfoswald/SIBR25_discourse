You opress minorities, toss out legal US citizens? Fine, maybe you just hate them THAT much.

You cut any safety nets we have? Fine, maybe you just want to shove the money in your ever increasing pockets.

You dismantle democracy? Fine. Maybe you just crave power that much.

But what is the point of this? This hurts everyone. Even the people at the very top will be hurt by this bill. When so many people lose their jobs and stop being able to buy things, corpos are hurt too! As are politicians. And I don't feel bad for them, I'm just confused.

1) Rural hospitals are often the only hospital in a 30-50 mile radius.  The serve populations that are older and less financially secure.  This means that a higher percentage of their payer mix is Medicare and Medicare.  A cut in funding closes these hospitals.

2) Our younger citizens have older relatives, grandparents parents, parents, uncles and aunts, even siblings. Much of their care needs are covered by Medicare.  There may no longer be funding for rehab stays, nursing homes, in home care or hospice.  This means actively employed individuals will have to incur debt to hire care or leave work to be the direct care provider. Your plumber may now be unable to leave home while caring for a parent with dementia&.for years.
3) The labor pool for care support such as certified nurses aids shrunk while demand is about to skyrocket.  International care sources are not coming for fear of imprisonment.  The under the table resources are similarly under threat.
4) You can no longer retire if you are dependent on your health care coverage from an employer.  Medicare is soon unlikely to cover many components of care.  Think things like organ transplant, related medications, dialysis, chemotherapy or radiation.  If you have a debilitating illness that makes it impossible to go to work&you must now go to work for coverage or die.

yes. thats maybe cruel... but Take into consideration the benefits

weak unhealthy and old people die early

less Pension spendings

health Industrie makes less Money, Higher competition, prices going down so good for they healthy people insurance cost

because more weak people are dying means less homeless and poor people = more cheap Appartments available. Good for the people and less prices because less people for more available Appartments or Houses.

less social Security spendings

less chep China stuff Imports

MCDonalds etc getting better and cheaper

less criminals

more funerals good for the death industry

etc.

On the right militarists, royalists, fascists and the religious right, all with pretty separate agendas fought under a single banner, ignored the fact that they did not like each other and were content with killing their enemies first before moving on to killing their allies.

The left was split between the liberals, communists, syndicalists, socialists and anarchists and if you dared leaving it at just that you would get shoot by the Trocyists for daring to lump them together with the Stalinists. They spent about as much time fighting each other as they did fighting Franco which is largely why they lost. 

This was litteral life or death, an open war and still one side decided ideology was more important than being pragmatic.

The left has actual values and that's nice, but this frequently turns into the left badmouthing itself just as bad as the opposition.

Always has been bro

at least since 2001 when Diebold machines turned a bunch of southern states ruby red, and the GOP has been working on ways to expand their invisible vote flipping ever since. The very same anomalies experts found in the 2024 vote totals were seen decades ago in places like Georgia (2001 - 2018, when those machines were removed in 2018) and Kentucky in the early 2010s etc...

Eventually they realized they don't need to build compromised voting machines, when they can just alter the count instead. ES&amp;S (formerly Diebold) tabulators are in 70% of precincts now, and counties that use the ES&amp;S tabulators (such as the DS450) showed a 7% swing toward Trump vs counties that do not use them.

The code in question functions only on the Presidential election, only on certain dates, and only once a given tabulator has counted a minimum 400 or 600 votes (depending on model). That's how they avoid being detected by recounts.

Note: No state has ever done the full hand manual recount needed to uncover this. When certain states tried, Republicans blocked them.",4_1_1_2_2_2

Yep. As much as I applaud AOC and Bernie's efforts to rally support in red states, they've been doing it by painting Musk as the mastermind, rather than using him as a lightning rod. Which, I can't really blame them for. I doubt they'd be so successful if they blatantly demonstrated that Musk is just one part of the administration these people voted for. Kneejerk reactionaries aren't well known for being introspective when told they made the wrong choice.

I guess it's a matter of whether a little good in the wrong direction is better than no good in the right direction. Maybe somewhere in those red states, there's... two, maybe even three voters who have the required brain cells to rub together to realize Musk is just a symptom and not the disease.

He picked the cuts. 
He benefited new and expanded contracts. 
He has our public records.
He knows government secrets.
He's left his starlink satellite dishes in restricted government spaces. 
He's put anti regulation on AI into the ""Big Beautiful Bill""
He's getting the Golden Dome 1.5B $$$ contract 
He was there today to discuss missions to Mars.
He knows that if he is found guilty in anything he's done in the last 4 to 5 months, he'll be pardoned. (Which may or may not include alleged election interference.)

He paid to deregulate himself and for that sweet sweet pardon. His fortune wasn't hit hard enough to make a dent. He'll jet away to some safehouse if he needed to. This man isn't leaving government and will continue to give money to politicians that benefit him.

So Musk didnt really know what anything did in the government, didnt ask for help or guidance, and brought in a bunch of essentially kids to help him slash and break stuff.

&gt;An investigation was launched by school officials, who questioned multiple teachers and other staff. Calhoun was the only teacher who admitted to using the teens chosen name. She had taught the student since 2022, before the rule was enacted.

&gt;Calhoun said she wasnt using the students chosen name with any political intent and said she was shocked when she learned she was in violation of school policy.

&gt;The final report recommended that Calhoun receive a letter of reprimand stating that she had violated four separate Florida statutes and policies.

&gt;There was no recommendation that Calhoun be fired for the offense.

&gt;Despite that, Superintendent Mark Rendell made the decision not to renew Calhouns contract. The district reported Calhouns violation to the state.

&gt;Supporters of Calhoun have been out in force at school board meetings since she was severed in April. She showed up at a meeting herself this week and was given a standing ovation.

&gt;Retired teacher Bill Pearlmans testimony was typical of the outpouring of support.

&gt;He told board members: You showed no kindness, no compassion, no due process, and no recognition of the excellence that she has shared with the estimated 3,000 students in her career at BPS, he said of Calhoun. Many of us are really disappointed in our superintendent and our board.

So, Christian nationalists view being kind and nice to every student as somehow grooming children. Somehow, calling a child by a name and esteeming a child in the process is nefarious to Christian nationalists. 

  
Christian nationalists literally just want to revert the world to their ""Inherit the Wind"" bullcrap. They hate anyone who doesn't ascribe to their Sunday School mentality. It's gross. Fuck this shit! Melissa Calhoun is a victim of this new Briggs Initiative! A great teacher has been removed from a Florida classroom, and those kids are going to suffer because of it.",2

* provide a distraction to those whose lives have been destroyed by the broken system, making revolt against the system less likely
* instill the fear of turning into a homeless methhead into the wage slaves which keeps them in line and willing to work for peanuts
* help replenish the exploited prison slave labor force

All of this helps entrench the power of the people at the top.

- The parents, who hate their own teenage daughter for being trans, decided to take it out on a trusted adult in their childs life by destroying her career with support from the state.

I have been vocal of life getting better for more people over time statistically speaking in terms of less poverty and lower mortality rates. Especially when doomers focus on all the sensationalism news spreads.

However even I can see its getting worse. You dont have to look at the news. You just have to look at the policies the current administration that is in power is enforcing.

1. American citizens and legal immigrants with no arrest records have been deported without due process. Trump wont listen to the Supreme Courts decision to get them back or stop. 

2. A fat tax bill that will benefit corporations and add trillions of dollars to the deficit has just been passed. 

3. America has an unprovoked trade war that has introduced tariffs that are leading many companies to raise prices on American consumers&in a time when our economy was booming and we had the fastest recovery of any nation following covid.

4. Weve made friends with our enemies (Russia) and turned on our allies (Mexico, Canada, Europe).

5. Multiple programs that benefit the working class and the poor have been gutted. The administration has also been vocal about privatization of social security.

6. Censorship of schools and media has been enforced.

7. Thousands of homeland terrorists who attacked the Capitol on January 6th were freed. Hundreds of which literally assaulted police officers.

8. The assault on womens autonomy has been unfolding starting with Roe being overturned by a supreme court that was stacked by Trump during his first term.

9. Bigotry and hate has always existed but it was taboo and progressive societies tend to stigmatize things like racism and misogyny. With a president who is unrelenting in his hateful rhetoric, a billionaire literally doing Nazi salutes in public, and social media influencers and pundits brazenly spreading hate, the stigmatization of these things has been eroded.

10. The administration has pushed for deregulation to kill efforts for clean energy in exchange for fossil fuel profits. Corruption is evident on so many levels including Trump accepting a 400 million dollar plane from a foreign country (illegal according to the emoluments act), the installment of literal tv personalities and celebrities as his cabinet in order to keep loyalists around who will do his bidding. 

11. Social media has become a tool for misinformation. It has also impacted a generation of young people into becoming more depressed than any previous youth. 

I can keep going but you get the picture. These things are either codified into law or mostly done through executive order.

We live in unprecedented times. This is not brain rot or existential crisis. This is reality we live in and there is fear that we as a country will not be able to undo the harm this administration has caused. This may have been in the works for years, but we are in the final stages of late stage capitalism and ours is the first generation that will witness a true decline as a nation and world power.",7_1_1_1

They're a pain in the ass to get, but anyone can get one if you can legally buy a gun. There's just a lot of paperwork and fees and waiting involved. And silencers don't actually make guns as quiet as Hollywood movies would have you believe, except maybe a .22 which is super fun to shoot when silenced. 

Also, the only reason they required the tax stamp in the first place is because someone randomly slipped the language into the original National Firearms Act in 1934 and it was never even debated. And whoever added it almost certainly never even saw one, let alone used one. So it's hilarious that the main complaint is that this was slipped into the bill without debate.

Also, fun fact about silencers, they were invented by the same guy who invented the automobile muffler. And silencers are easier to get in other countries like France than guns are, no extra taxes or anything. It's just another gun accessory, not something dangerous and doesn't make a gun more dangerous.",3

Miller has sawed off shotgun.  Hughes court believes in ""collectivist"" theory on the second amendment, today's Robert's court believes in ""individual"" theory.

Hughes court decides that as no military unit, nor militia, (read the entire amendment please people) uses a saw off shotgun nor has use for it in gear, it does not qualify under the 2nd, so illegal.

Same goes for silences. Or at least, should have, under that logic.  But I'll read into it.",3_5

WASHINGTON  When House Republicans passed President Donald Trumps sweeping domestic policy package in the wee hours of Thursday, they didnt just approve giving trillions of dollars in tax cuts to rich people while kicking down millions of poor people.

They made it easier to get gun silencers. And quietly removed a weird provision about tanning beds. And expanded a ban on gender-affirming care. And, in a show of fealty to the president, they came up with a new name for tax-saving accounts that the government would seed with $1,000 for babies born in the next few years: Trump Accounts.

There was already a lot going on in the GOPs 1,100-page bill, which is actually called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. But things got confusing late Wednesday when Republicans unveiled a 42-page amendment with all kinds of eleventh-hour changes. They released their new language as the House Rules Committee was entering its 20th hour of a hearing on the bill, and Democrats barely had time to make sense of all the changes.

Theyre a lot clearer now. 

Here's a link to the full article, which includes the weird and last-minute things Republicans slipped into their bill: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-tax-bill-gun-silencers-tanning-beds-weird\_n\_682f55ebe4b09130a5859e17?utm\_medium=Social&amp;utm\_source=reddit&amp;utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-tax-bill-gun-silencers-tanning-beds-weird_n_682f55ebe4b09130a5859e17?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=us_main)",7

I'm curious if they will be used in cities. Like illegal machine gun conversions, there is a black market for them. While full auto kits turn up at arrests and crime scenes, rarely do you see loophole suppressors. 


My working theory is that the cost of a threaded barrel makes it more difficult to mount. So many guns that turn up in evidence lockers are, to put it bluntly, junk. Aftermarket parts don't really exist for some of the crap I've seen, and thus no mounting options.",8_2

These same people think that due process is ""red tape"" that stops them from just deporting the illegals

These are simple people. They're morons. They have blind trust in these systems because they've never failed *them* before, so they think changing the system is fine, actually, because they'll be the exception. 

These are the people who see something they think is wrong, and decide they should be judge, jury, and executioner. ""I saw an able-bodied person get out of a vehicle with a handicapped sticker! If It were up to me, I'd take em to jail right then!"" Meanwhile the person has a crippling disorder that's good some days, bad others, but that nuance doesn't matter. ""If you aren't actively in a wheelchair, I don't believe you're disabled enough to park there!"" 

They see someone of hispanic descent working as a day-laborer, they think ""they're obviously illegal, ship them out!"" but they aren't. There's numerous circumstances that could lead them to be like that. But the conservative *perceived them* as an ""Illegal migrant"" and that's enough for them to want to ""skip all that due process mumbo jumbo and TAKE'EM AWAY, BOYS!"" 

When you realize they have a gradeschool conception of most of these things, it rapidly becomes apparent that they're deeply unserious and really shouldn't be a part of many of these political discussions. Abortion is another example. ""When a daddy and a mommy love each other VERY MUCH, they go into the bedroom and call the stork. Mommy gets pregnant with a baby in her belly! and nine months later, they have the baby, and mommy and daddy and baby are happy and nothing bad ever happens!"" You can easily imagine each panel of this drawn in clumsy crayon.

Ask them about ectopic pregnancies. They blank. Ask them about any number of the real complexities of the topic and they basically plug their ears. They are not smart. They are unserious.",3_1_1_3

Thats how Bone Saw gets what he wants, because he can give orders to whoever to carry out whatever without facing repercussions. Thats what Donnie wants, thats what his team wants, so thats what they work towards and this is just one of the steps",3_8

No, I just havent heard any good case for how Obama won in 2008 with the middle name Hussein and carrying Florida, but then 13% of his base decided being a bigot was cool and voted for Trump. 

What does make sense is that Obama ran on reforming Wall Street and pulling us out of endless wars as an outsider who painted a vision of a diverse America where the rewards of globalism are spread evenly because of a unified working class. 

Harris and Hillary ran as friendly with both Wall Street and the military-industrial complex. If Biden didnt have Trumps covid mishandling to run on, he wouldve been part of this pattern. Thats why Americans do actually give Biden credit for handling covid but not his economic vision after.

&gt; Americans arent swayed by nuance theyre swayed by big simple things. Thats why in 2016 trumps big simple messages won.

Believe it or not Democrats actually look worse in the nuance. As a researcher I promise you theres nothing Ive seen a campaign produce that I would consider acceptable if an undergrad handed it to me as a proposal. 

For example, how do you plan to deal with the growing systemic inequality produced by the modern global economy that allowed capital to freely find and exploit cheap labor like the way Apple flooded China with training capital using the taxpayers dollars?

Trump said crazy high tariffs even at the expense of democratic norms to force companies back and give workers the power they had before, I dont care that dumb nerds hate my idea

Harris said things are fine actually, this graph made at a college your kids cant afford to attend says you made 1% real growth in inflation this last year and they can get a 25k tax credit when they try to buy a home in 20 years

&gt; People wanted actively to not vote trump. 

No, people wanted actively to vote for change. They had to overcome a lot to vote for a black women they barely knew except for the time she lost the 2020 primary who said she wouldnt change a thing, instead of a rich white businessman who claimed he was going to build industry domestically and was robbed of it last term but sent stimulus checks as proof of him sharing the wealth.

It is really as simple as who do I think will put more money in my pocket? and Democrats just dont make that argument until Republicans cause a crisis. Its the economy, stupid 

If Harris had run as a fiercely anti-corruption candidate who would use her cartel busting skills on America and unleash an army of DOJ lawyers to complete Obamas promise to reform Wall Street and finally pass universal healthcare, she wouldve swept the election. It wouldve made total sense as a transition from Biden, who was Obamas VP and also saved us from a Republican-fueled crisis.

I dont think we should be rhetorically arguing in moral terms at all. For some reason our party got in the habit of this maybe because of the lawyering, but the argument for class solidarity is a purely selfish one. You get wealthier, safer, and freer by cooperating with other labor rather than capital which seeks to exploit you.

Most people internalize hate and bigotry as a rationalization or outlet for other problems in their life. People who have no real problems tend to not be swayed by radical conspiracy theories and hate. We tend to think problems caused by nature (or big systems that feel like a force of nature like the government) cant be helped, but problems caused by people cheating us can (or problems that can be solved by cheating others). 

So the right argues that traditional institutions are natural and correct, and problems are caused by people not following the rules and cheating. That lends itself to us vs them mentalities and oppression of them.

We as a party cant seem to say the problems are caused by the institutions and they need to change clearly enough, so people dont really have any other explanation for their problems.

Thats horrible and discounts lots of women who are so much better and gifted in so many different ways. Youre just lumping them all together as if theres no difference. 

How about we focus on how Harris and Hillary both proudly embraced their Wall Street connections at a time when people are convinced big businesses are cheating everyday workers? You know, the idea that was so popular that changing it got a young black man named Hussein elected, who remains one of the most popular US politicians alive right now? Who 13% of Trump supporters had supported? Who won Florida 20 years ago?

Americans would happily vote for a woman who promised to break up big banks, big pharma, big agriculture, big tech, and the wealth of all the billionaires who unfairly profited off the exploitation of labor in the globalist economy.

This is downplaying what I said around class dynamics and sexism. I was very clear that a corporatist platform defending class interests of the wealthy specifically shapes how sexism impacts voting behaviors and means Harris/Hillary are seen differently even in their identity as women because of it, but you just waved all that away. Youre still looking at this as an election that was about the identity of individual leaders and not a rejection of shifting American identities under globalism. 

The feminine identity that Hillary and Harris represent to the public is tainted by the superficial brand of DEI Democrats embraced because they avoid substantive reform for the working class. So theres a suspicion that Hillary and Harris are just entitled and using their woman card to get ahead in primaries, which then fully opens the gate to sexist biases. It doesnt help that both had lost primaries before, and when they won it was at least in part because of a lack of challenges. 

So a woman running on populist economics with working-class ties is going to be seen as a different type of woman to the public, because **they actually are**. It came out after Harris took over that the Biden team didnt bother doing any research on her strengths and weaknesses. They very literally did the same thing Im criticizing here, which is tokenizing a marginalized identity and reducing someones identity to it. 

&gt; Women voted for him 

because he was a Republican. Again, our politics today is not about individual candidates and their merits but what interests candidates advance by being in office. Politicians are just tools, use them and lose them.

&gt; But they have to get past the patriarchy and their ethnicities. 

Ethnicities?

&gt; America post Trump isnt the America of 2008

Right, that famously progressive America as the surveillance state was rapidly expanding in response to 9/11, conservatism discovered Internet meme, and a population thats about 10% more white kept a ban on gay marriage. 

Obama was just a good politician. There are other good politicians. Nothing about his situation cannot be replicated, including for any other marginalized group. What doesnt work is picking bad politicians and going why isnt this getting results like a good politician? And what especially doesnt work is well I cant see how this woman is any different than any other woman

&gt; Also, Obama, despite being half black and had a Muslim middle name, was still a man. 

You will not convince me a black inexperienced man with a Muslim name less than a decade after 9/11 had less prejudice against him than the white woman who was literally in the White House already. She was polling as the front runner among *all* candidates in 2014, including the Republicans, with favorables above 50. No, people liked her just fine until she asked to be President and decided the Third Way love for big businesses screwed workers over.

&gt; Trump had made it ok to be forthright with bigotry 

No one needed Trumps permission to be bigoted lmao. Plenty of that openly going around before. Trump just didnt have the nuance to hide it. I prefer a small government and market based solutions was always dogwhistle for I want my government snatching people for free labor by driving them systematically into poverty until they commit crimes to survive and we can lock them up.

I would say hes more of a working class type than most in office. Why didnt he win? He had the words, the platform, I believe he could have gotten real things accomplished.

First, Bernies progressive leftism is not the only type of populism Democrats can run on. Harris couldve run on promising a dirt cheap public healthcare option and declaring a war on white collar crime to break up monopolies (which puts her around Warren and Obama from 08-16) and won. This would be *less* leftist than her own Senate M4A proposal she co-sponsored with Bernie while being just as populist, by favoring a reset of the financial markets to favor workers over state welfare expansion. 

This is an important point because my argument is not Bernies platform wouldve won and everyone should adopt it. 

Its that the status quo sucks because of corporatism and even someone as fringe and last-minute as Bernie can make enormous gains against establishment candidates

So now lets look at 2016: an independent Senator who calls himself a socialist from an overlooked small state decided to join the Democrats and run against one of the most famous names in American politics, whose partner had looked over a famously good economy. He got 43% of the vote while disavowing super PAC money and actively pissing off the rich every speech, promising to tear down the systems behind that famously good economy.

That is a **damning** indictment of the party, as if sending Obama in over Hillary wasnt already a signal that the 90s centrism gave elites all the benefits of globalism and people were figuring it out on *both* sides. One of the very few things thats truly bipartisan is the certainty that the rich control everything, which is why theres outsider appeal that seems to transcend logic about competence and qualifications.

And by the way, I think Bernie benefitted from Hillary clearing the field for herself in the primaries. Securing all the superdelegates worked in *his* favor because it cleared out any other moderate competition, so she became the face of the party and Bernie could brand himself as the populist rejection of it. Another populist politician could easily have done it and much better than Bernie but this partys imagination is dead, so it took an Independent coming in to raise the challenge.",22_5_1_1_1_1_1_1_1

The point of winning is to have a society that understands diversity is a strength. Because it is.

It improves working class solidarity and paves over social divisions. Companies like Apple refuse to get rid of DEI programs for a reason.

Democrats for some reason dont make this argument that is supported by facts and provides a direct counter to Trumps claim that diversity weakens us. They make the argument of well do half of what Republicans do and get a token minority to do it

Are you trying to list qualifications lol

*Data* from both before the election and in exit polls all show that voters were mostly driven by economic concerns, and even Harris voters were more motivated to oppose Trump than support her. This just very simply points to a failure to communicate an economic message. Its a problem when your own base doesnt even understand and get excited about you.


&gt; You can keep trying (worked out great the last few times hasnt it?).

What they all had in common is that they ran on the status quo where Wall Street and billionaires continue to get richer while everyone else struggles with basic needs. They get 1% real wage growth or something, even though its not nearly enough.

This is just pseudoscience. None of this has scientific consensus behind it. You can choose to believe it anyways but I dont really do religious conversations, and I dont accept that anyone is so exceptional. You and I have biases, even if theyre unconscious.

No, I just think its beyond dumb to discount women because of the idea women cant win. Its the same reasoning that wouldve led us to discount Obama, who is liked above most white politicians in the US. Its as if we did 0 analysis on any of the details of how Harris ran her platform, campaign, or reputation prior to 2024 and jumped straight to her being a black woman. Its weirdly reducing people to their gender and race and stereotyping them and ending up at racism all over again. Its just bad strategy.

I suggest (am not sure) maybe the reason why youre confused about why democrats dont hammer on dei stuff is because

&gt; its their glaring weakness. 

Everything is their weakness because they dont defend any of it. Republicans drive the entire narrative in this country while Democrats play defense. 

Theyre spending $200m attacking us on DEI, should we respond? No, lets talk about how democracy is at risk, because people are feeling very inspired by their ability to vote for change in my status quo campaign where I say nothing will change.

Its not a complex point at all. This is like when people thought explaining gay marriage is too complex to voters. Its not, we just need to actually try instead of letting Fox explain it for us 24/7. No one has trouble understanding you should diversify your investments. Americans know what theyre paying into with a 401k, which a majority of workers do. The same thing applies to labor markets. Diverse capital needs diverse labor. This is literally a simple capitalist perspective that big companies apply everyday. Tell companies youll heavily subsidize skilled immigrant labor if they also hire a domestic worker for a different role, and you have a reason both big businesses and workers should support you, while keeping us competitive in a global economy. 

Instead Fox News drives the narrative on diversity, which has to mean a bunch of silly college activists making cringe online that impacts no one while wasting everyones time and resources.  

&gt; In this case winning is quantifiable. Winning office. This definition does not change

Then just be pro-Trump, get Elons money, and win as a MAGA Democrat. As long as you win office, its all the same right?

Democrats dont need to surrender diversity. They need to remember why theyre the party of diversity. Its not because were morally superior, its because it makes the most sense for an economy for literally everyone.",22_11_1_1_1_1_1

And if a detainee is stuck in Louisiana, it's because they're objecting being brought back to their country of citizenship.  A foreigner being deported overseas is usually only detained for as long as medically required to complete a disease screening.

The core issue is still your confusion of criminal with administrative processes.  A former Massachusetts AG once wisely pointed out that ""it's not illegal to be illegal"" which sums it up.  You don't go to prison for being an illegal alien.  You're just sent back home.

But thats exactly the opposite of what workers  and tipped workers in particular  need.

&gt; Tipped workers are underpaid. Some of them would certainly see their take-home pay increase if the federal government stops taxing them on tips, assuming that their wages stay the same. But tips can be volatile, and often vary by season, and a no tax on tips policy would make offseasons worse for tipped workers, who will likely be stuck with lower base pay. 

&gt; The reality is that the problem for tipped workers isnt that their taxes are too high  its that their wages are far too low. Plus, not having their taxes tipped means workers might end up accruing less credit toward their Social Security.

&gt; In fact, many underpaid workers wont even see a difference from the policy. Some tipped workers  by some estimates more than a third of them  earn so little that they are already exempt from income taxes, which means that a no tax on tips law would do nothing to boost their take-home pay. More than that, no tax on tips doesnt help out most low-wage workers: More than 95 percent of low- and moderate-wage workers dont receive tips on a regular basis.",7

The net gain wont be all that much.

However, think about how many stores and establishments have a tip amount option, even places where we havent been traditionally expected to tip.  Employers will hang this around their employees necks and claim they dont need to pay anyone more than minimum wage because you get tips and those arent taxed.  More employers will be incentivized to add tip jars and tipping options to their point of sale machines because the mere possibility of tips justifies them paying their workers less and saving money.  Get ready to be expected to tip the cashier at the grocery store.  This then shifts the burden of paying worker wages to everyday customers, many of whom also work for tips.

You can see the opposite with Mackenzie Scott and Dolly Parton, who give so much to charity they don't break into billionaire status, or whose interest on their wealth earns them so much they can't give enough way.

I don't see how it's not literally just pathological hoarding. Surrounding themselves with more stuff than they could possibly ever need, either to fill some sort of void or as a shield to help them feel safe from the world around them.

you can especially see it with Elon because he's so public. All his adult kids either openly dislike him or at least don't want to be publicly associated with him, his intense desire to be a likeable charismatic ""meme lord"", throwing in with whatever group it is he thinks will accept him (first it was environmentalists, then it was nerds/gamers, then it was MAGA). All of it points to him having an extremely need to be liked and accepted and it never works because he's a repulsive freak who barely understands how to be human. 

and the only thing he won't do is actually spend money on likeable causes. He'll go on stage with Dave Chapelle and he'll do a cameo on Rick and Morty/The Simpsons and pay someone so he can pretend he's good at video games, but he's unwilling to do anything that isn't immediately self serving* with his unimaginable wealth. 

If he was willing to just break even, or even take a loss, he could have affordable electric cars on the street by next year, he could personally fund an army of environmental lawyers that take cases nobody else can afford to, buy land and build huge nature preserves that rival national parks, provide solar/wind power to homes/communities/offices at low-no cost. Any one of these things would have made him a super star among the environmentalist crowd he initially tried to pander to, but he was unwilling to do anything but keep Tesla a luxury product because it makes him look better. The nerds would even easier to satisfy, he could create game studios to just make whatever they want**, fund adaptations for older or less popular games/manga without worrying about budget or profit, buy dead IPs from the big publishers and give them new life.

because even with that void in his soul, if he even still has one, his gigantic piles of money bring him more comfort than doing these things.

He is not a smart man, average IQ maybe (there are tons of average IQ people that have done well for themselves and their communities).

He's all about image and IS really talented at showmanship/ telling people what they want to hear. Ethics are for suckers and has ZERO empathy towards others.  He never could make money that wasn't at someone else's expense, a bank or investor has to lose big for him to turn a profit.

They own the majority of the rights to South Africa's Mineral wealth.

Since the collapse of apartheid there have been increasing calls to nationalise the mines and stop the export of rare earth minerals. It is one of the Founding Goals of Julias Malemas EDF Party, which is the ANCs main opposition.

With their place in BRICS if the BRICS nations drop the US Petro Dollar and go back on the Gold Standard, it would give South Africa one of the most valuable economies in the world. If Ramoposa decided to nationalise the mines, he would consolidate his power and silence his opposition.

Both China and Russia have invested heavily in South Africa and it was the training they received from Cuba that helped them overthrow the Apartheid Government.

The apartheid Government left a stong legacy of defences along our coastlines. Fearing attack and invasion from allied nations, they developed costal batteries with artillery that could sink a destroyer days before it reached South African waters. The weapons developers Armscore and Denel have the facilities for full scale weapon production. South Africa is the only country to have successfully denuclearised however we still have the facilities to enrich weapons grade uranium which we can easily import from Zimbabwe (who sits on one of the world's largest deposits.

Costal batteries, strong allies and no reason not to. How long do you think an African president is going to take blatant insults?",77_1_1

America is currently tearing itself apart trying to give money away to fabulously wealth people and trying to undo Biden's Infrastructure Week bill. A bill that many economists and civil planners criticized for not going remotely close to far enough to deal with decades of neglect.

So while America argues about how many zeroes should be in Bezos' account and relishes at the concept of a Tofu Dreg project making easy ChinaBad^(tm) content, they're currently ignoring (for example, among many many many other things) 7.5% of bridges in the US being classified as ""structurally deficient.""

Watching videos of people living in Chongqing is wild. You can argue that city and many like it are dystopian hellscapes, that's fine, many people simply don't care.

Problem is for this regime is they offer no carrot for capitulation.  It doesn't work in lessening their wrath or their focus.  So highly resourced institutions like Harvard are choosing to resist, using the courts to battle edicts, and adjusting their mission, resources, and offerings to survive until a better day.  Who knows if that'll happen, but the Trump regime knows if they can break Harvard, they can break any university.  

The only leverage they truly have is financial.  Cut off grant funding.  Cut off the ability to enroll international students.  Next will be an inability to use federal financial aid money.  And perhaps past finances is removing accreditation.  So we're at step two.  Foreign students tend to pay full tuition so this is truly about hurting Harvard financially.

It doesn't matter if it's Harvard, it already happened with Columbia first. It will continue to happen with other universities. A government meddling with the independence of higher education institutions is incredibly important.

There's a reason why college campuses are the site of birth of most protests in history, why research, scientific advancement and technology all happen within academic institutions or in collaboration with them. There's a reason why college campuses are considered to be outside of government control and governed at the discretion of the faculty. In all moments of war throughout history, universities have been a place of asylum just like churches.

Americans should have revolted a while ago. Maybe when they deported innocent people to El Salvador or when they jailed a mayor and a judge or when they disobeyed orders from the Supreme Court or when the President said he didn't know if he would uphold the Constitution.

It captures not only the events leading up to the Trump administration's decision to bar international students from Harvard but also the universitys failure to properly address hate speech on its campus. The article reflects on Harvards hesitancy to condemn genocidal rhetoric, the leadership's shocking response during congressional hearings, and the ensuing donor revolt. It also covers the emotional impact on Jewish students and alumni who have long supported the institution. I believe it offers a crucial perspective on how universities must confront bigotry head-on and the consequences when they dont. The piece is thought-provoking and raises important questions about accountability and moral leadership in academia. Its well worth reading, and I think its important to share.

Secondly if taxpayer dollars being spent effectively for a functioning university is your concern, then kicking out all international students is horrible for that. Graduate students are probably not who you thought of when you saw this article, but this does affect them.

You know who does the vast majority of teaching and research? It's graduate students. Professors can design courses and steer research directions, but grad students are the ones setting up experiments, teaching discussion sections, writing research papers and grading undergrad student work. 

27% of Harvard's graduate students are international. Twenty. Seven. Percent.

Do you have any idea how catastrophic it would be for a company to fire 27% of its employees?

The effects would be far worse in graduate school. Over many years graduate students accumulate knowledge and skills for teaching and researching highly niche topics for which there is no easy replacement. It's extremely important for older grad students to pass that knowledge down to new ones. This goes on for generations of graduate students. If you kick 27% of them out, that knowledge transfer will not happen. Generations of knowledge is lost. Classes will be no longer offered or downsized. In progress research projects will be abandoned and unpublished, their knowledge effectively thrown into the trash. All people at the university, international or not, will suffer the effects for many years to come.

2nd point TL;DR Grad students perform the majority of teaching and research work at universities. Firing 27% of them would have catastrophic results.",38_4_1_1

Is it a catastrophe if the elites of this country dont get their fancy education? Obviously Harvard will work something out with this administration so the doomsday scenario is moot, but just think about why you hold this socially corrosive institution so dear in the first place&

And dont give me the research BS, they can use their $50B endowment, whether the funds are liquid or not. The US patent system was created to spur research and government funds have no business being used in this arena.",38_4_1_1_1

They've worked for many years towards their degrees so it's completely unfair to suddenly force them out of the school. International graduate students also sometimes have their visas threatened by advisors to force them to work grueling gours. Establishing visas as even more delicate would open the door to further abuse. Not to mention this will have a chilling effect on all universities. If Harvard can be retaliated against by the government for not bending the knee, then any university can.

Again, the research point is an issue of workers. Not funding. Suddenly stripping away 27% of their workforce will have heavy damages on operations that money alone cannot solve.

Lastly, as a scientist, I can say it is a terrible idea to strip government funding from research in general.  A huge portion of fundamental science that researchers carry out cannot be meaningfully patented, so a patent incentivized system would kill that crucial type of science. Furthermore a patent based system would prioritize profitability over all else, which is a priority incompatible with doing good science.

I don't have any particular allegiance to wealthy institutions and I'm all too familiar with the abuses of power by rich university administrators. I oppose this for the reasons stated above, and for the fact that if this is allowed to happen then it sets the precedent that the executive branch can attack universities for any perceived slights.",38_4_1_1_1_1

I'm not sure though. Maybe I am too optimistic about the general population. I agree to do so was genuinely insane, but I would think some to have an understandable insanity, if that makes sense?

I wouldn't blame anyone for feeling apathetic about voting purely for the sake of voting *against* someone who looks entirely, utterly incompetent. With the way the US system works, people need to feel *energized* to vote.

A lot of people don't want to recognize that, while Biden's term may have been a good one (or as good as it could be), the complete lack of accountability, the sheer incompetence that led to Garland getting the AG position, the promises to return to an already stagnant status quo, and calls for a return to bipartisanship *with a group of people who literally tried to overthrow the country not even a month prior* has done more to demoralize the left than any voter suppression laws. The Democratic Party has loudly, and proudly, told every person afraid of persecution by white nationalists that their fears are less important than them making peace with people who want them dead.

Yes, x Bill was good. Yes, y policy was great. But ultimately? The only thing that mattered was the safeguarding of democracy, and Biden's admin did not take that threat seriously. If anything, saying Republicans are a threat to our democracy in one breath, then demanding bipartisanship in the next, makes poorly informed people take the threat ***less*** seriously.

That said No one in our line of work or profession will acknowledge this as legitimate btw because 1.) its based on nonsense and 2.) it would violate the ethics and standards that we uphold (and violating those would lead to possible board hearings and license suspensions). So no , no one is going to go along with this and no insurances or medical doctors are going to follow this if it ever became an NIH mandate. 

Side note 1 : Plenty of our colleagues have the power, through evaluation and evidence based testing,  to recommend granting or revoking firearms permits and ownership btw based on psychological fitness and stability. Quite literally many roles that require firearms and also many permits and licenses require a psychological screening. This can also be ordered by a court to undergo this kind of evaluation. 

Side note 2: Accreditation of our training and programs lies with an organization outside of federal control and licensing and boarding lies with state boards not federal boards. So the NIh and federal government would have little say if any on mandating anyone actually follow such absurdity about mental illness for expressing ones opinion.

The key thing in my message is that this is highly difficult to do in a country with 50 different state governments as well as countless counties and cities; all with their own local and state governments. Theres 50 different state boards with different requirements and regulations. Sure they may corrupt some red states , which would just lead to many psychologists moving to and getting licensed in other states. Theres plenty of states that will simply ignore any of these NIH proposals as they should.  The Soviet Union was highly centralized and did not have 50 different state governments. The US, and Ive made this same point to people who worry that there will be be some mass armed conflict across the US, is that both geographically and government power wise the US is decentralized. What happens in one state isnt guaranteed to, or even logistically possible, in another state. This wasnt by accident.

I agree with a lot of people who think this couple and all the farmers that voted against their financial interests should sell their equipment and their farm. They can learn to code or get a fast food job. I never realized how much federal government support, these anti-government farmers receive. A lot of these farms seem like expensive hobbies supported by blue state taxes. 
 Their state governments need to figure out a way to subsidize these expensive welfare farms. For national security reasons, I would like to keep some farms around to make sure we have a domestic supply of food that cant be disrupted by foreign sanctions. But those farms can be in blue states. Those state governments in blue states can direct their federal taxes in state, rather than supporting welfare farms in red states.
  Id love to see these welfare farms purchased by state governments or NGOs and made into state parks. Having large tracts of land will attract wildlife and tourists. Tourism will be the new source of income for these areas.

On the other hand they also have a lot of incompetence and inefficiency that OP didnt mention, as you mentioned in your first point: its arguable whether several of the macro projects were actually necessary and couldnt have been achieved by more numerous smaller scale less destructive projects.

Buttigieg actually had tried to address it, but the bill trying to improve ATC infrastructure was struck down by congress. It was known it was becoming a problem during the Biden administration. It was just made worse with probationary firings and rifs- ATC wasn't originally spared, and though they attempted to ""rehire"" they cannot actually force everyone back. Support staff was also not always considered essential staff, meaning there's less people doing non critical jobs that still need to be done to function (in the case of this woman, it appears her immediate supervisor was, which is what left her solo). This is what's amplifying an already big problem

Moves like this are nowhere near instant and have dozens of moving parts. Even trying to fix this could take years at this point, even if it's just putting it back the way it was. These are not easy changes to make",6_3

TCJA (Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act) was passed in 2017, went into effect in 2021, R&amp;D expenses went from 100% write-off to amortize over 5 to 15 years, so my company (like many other bootstrapped startups who took just enough money from investors and customers to pay the developers salaries) started laying off and ultimately went out of business at the end of 2023.

They're talking about fixing it now, you know, the problem they created. Break a window and sell you the replacement! It's a good approach, politically speaking, I mean it worked didn't it? Biden got the blame for our misfortune, many educated people didn't understand or even know what happened.

I'd call it class warfare against the knowledge workers, but since we in the tech industry are only about 6% of the population - and obviously we're far from the most oppressed class - I don't think that would rally too many people to my side. (Well, maybe here on Reddit it could.)",6_5

Democrats need a new face who has never run for President. I love AOC but I dont like the idea of her as President until we get to a place where free and fair elections are secured again.

Dems need someone who can come in and make impressions from a clean slate. Someone who can be nice and cordial but on the whole, someone who reflects the frustrations and frankly anger of blue America. Someone who doesnt mince words or plays by the 1950s rule book that establishment Dems play by i.e. rolling over and taking it. We need someone whos just as angry as us and as fearless as republicans have been. They need a new candidate. Not a Buttigieg or AOC or Walz, a new candidate who has a proven track record but ultimately is a new face to 99% of the country. Probably a veteran from a southern state so he has pull with those voter bases. Definitely straight and married with a very likable spouse. White, but not suburban white. 

Dems need someone with the drive of FDR and the fire of someone whos not taking any more bullshit. The time for a soft candidate has passed.

It is is projected to increase the federal deficit by hundreds of billions over the next decade.

Markets essentially took one look at that math and hit sell.

That reaction was compounded by a [poorly received 20-year Treasury auction](https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/markets/mbs-recap-05212025) on Wednesday.

Mobile homes, extended family arrangements, and ""doubling up"" with relatives or friends are far more common and culturally accepted throughout much of the South. These housing alternatives act as pressure valves, allowing people experiencing economic hardship, addiction, or untreated mental illness to avoid falling into visible homelessness. While these situations often reflect housing insecurity, they dont show up in official homelessness counts and reduce the need for shelters or encampments in public view. Another factor is that Southern housing markets tend to have lower barriers to entry based on cost. Rent is cheaper, and there are more entry-level units available, which makes it possible for individuals dealing with poverty, substance use, or mental health crises to retain some form of shelter. Moreover, the rural nature of much of the South means homelessness is dispersed and less visible; someone sleeping in a car in a church parking lot or living in an abandoned mobile home on private land is far less likely to be counted in HUD's point-in-time statistics than someone on a city sidewalk in San Francisco. While the South still suffers from addiction and mental illness at rates comparable to or higher than other regions, the presence of cheaper, more flexible housing options often keeps those individuals just housed enough to avoid the visible crises seen in major urban centers.",5_1_2_1_1

If you want to end unsheltered homelessness of this sort, then reopen the institutions and make it legal to make them stay in those institutions.  That would end much of the homelessness problem, particularly the most conspicuous examples of it.

That does not describe a housing problem.

That describes a deinstitutionalization problem.

Unsheltered homelessness surged after the Supreme Court made much institutionalization unconstitutional.  That moved the asylum population to jails and streets.

When the courts later made it effectively illegal for cities with large homeless populations to prosecute for vagrancy, that pushed the problem into places where prosecutions were avoided.

Those who were released from the asylums ended up on the streets.

The vast majority of the unsheltered homeless who we see today would be in asylums now were it not for the deinstitutionalization movement.

And today's drugs are worse.  The hard drug problem in Europe is largely dominated by heroin, for which there are treatments and alternatives for addicts to become productive.  

In the US, the drugs of choice are meth that makes people violent, and fentanyl which is a far more powerful and debilitating opioid with a high overdose rate.  

There is no pharmaceutical treatment for meth.  Few people kick it, and the 5-year relapse rate among those who complete a treatment program is close to 90%.

Housing does not solve those problems.  Treating One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as if it was a documentary when it was a work of fiction does not solve those problems.

That being said, much of the problem in California dates back to Jones v. Los Angeles, a 2009 9th Circuit case filed by the ACLU.  The city settled the case, agreeing to effectively end enforcement of vagrancy laws.

That would later provide the basis for Martin v. Boise, a ruling based on that settlement that applied to the entire 9th Circuit (the West Coast).  That in turn led to Johnson v Grants Pass.

California has tried to cope with these decisions by providing beds to the unsheltered, which became a federal requirement that only impacted the west.  I don't agree with much of what was done, but the state was not provided with a lot of lawful options.

Newsom encouraged the Supreme Court to overturn Johnson and Martin, which it did.  Now he is trying to get cities to ban encampments.  But not all of the localities are cooperating, most notably LA.  

Ultimately, a lot of what has gone wrong does not have much to do with Newsom.  Housing First is not unique to California and federal funding provided for homelessness mandates complying with it.  Those mandates came out of the administration of Bush 43.",9

Critics are giving a thumbs-down to a Republican plan to honor President Donald Trump by naming a program for babies after him. 

The program that would give each newborn a special savings account pre-loaded with $1,000 was initially called money account for growth and advancement, aka MAGA, Trumps longtime slogan.

But this week, Republicans changed it to the Trump Account as they tried to push their big beautiful bill through the House.

Critics agreed that money for babies is a good idea. In fact, Democrats have proposed a very similar plan before.

But they dont love the name  and spoke out on social media.

Heck .. go ahead and name it after a big baby, one person wrote. 

Definitely not a cult, said another.

The single worst political branding decision in American history was when the Republicans decided to make a huge effort to get people to refer to the ACA as ""Obamacare""

Unsurprisingly giving people money or Healthcare is incredibly popular, its why touching entitlements is considered the ""3rd rail"" of politics.

So when people started getting ACA help, they loved it, and because of the Obamacare branding, it became the thing most associated with Obama, and the first thing people think about him. Which made Obama popular and helped provide political cover for some of the not so good things he did.

Trump Accounts are clearly the GOP recognizing this and applying it to their side this time.

The answer is to do the hard work, collect evidence, document violations, try to flip University administrators that can testify as to the application of quotas, and then SLOWLY work their cases through the courts over a period of years.

Dear Senator

Please do not allow tax cuts for billionaires in the Big, Ugly Bill being sent over from the house. The U.S. deficit is a serious problem. It would not make logical sense to give tax cuts to billionaires when we have already made significant cuts to the following:

Veterans Administration

    - Harder for veterans to access care
    
    - More difficult to hire doctors and nurses

Social Security Administration

    - Harder for citizens to access their social security benefits

Science and research

    - Brain drain from the U.S. has already started

International aid (U.S. soft power)

    - Great gift to our global rival, China

It's called General Relief. It took an entire work day to apply (from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m.) and anywhere between two and three months for my application to be accepted.

To receive 200 dollars a month and less in food stamps, I once had to work in a public park picking up trash for 6 to 8 hours a day, five days a week. That was the hardest job I did because it was during the summer and outdoors. Most of the time, it was janitorial work at schools and a courthouse. 

I was lucky. I was young and physically capable. The program only allowed me to stay on for nine months, once a year. After that, you're off. It's harder to get on now because less unskilled labor is available for the program. 

The critical part of this anecdote is that programs with work requirements don't let people stay on them for long. And the work they sometimes find for you to do doesn't count as work experience, because you can't put it on a resume. There's no real record of you doing those jobs.

Job training is a non-starter. People who have vocational training and degrees have a hard time finding work. Some half-assed job training from a welfare program is worth less than nothing in today's job market.

They had a letter there signed by a group of the nation's top scientists who were aware of the plan because of their research interests pleading with the president not to target civilians with the nuclear weapons they had created. 

Their reasoning was that the US had more to lose than to gain because the US has several important metropolitain areas, Chicago, New York, LA that would be perfect targets for a nuclear revenge attack and that the secrets of nuclear weapons would soon spread uncontrollably. 
 
The administration ignored their pleas for a demonstration explosion away from populated areas. So far, the US had managed to get lucky based on the global desire to avoid nuclear armageddon but if Congress is eager for nuclear war, the luck may be running out. The National Mall adjacent to the Pentagon in DC is a hell of a target. People in glass houses throwing rocks had better realize the consequences could be sharp and painful.",56

No Democrats don't, that was proven in 2018. However what leftists have now done is shown to Black voters unequivocally that leftists are anti-black and are willing to throw black people under the bus to push their agenda. So now what you're going to have are Black voters and other younger voters who are not white seeing the racism first hand of leftist.

Before you think that's not the case look at the reaction of Black voters on social media to Bernie Sanders going on Andrew Schultz's podcast and talking his dumb shit about identity politics. Basically the Messiah of the leftist movement has pretty much confirmed what a lot of Black voters have been telling people about him and there's not going to be any coming back from that. What a lot of leftists hate to admit and seem to forget is that the movers and shakers of the Democratic Party are Black voters.",86_1_1_1_1

My aunt, her husband, their 3 kids, and 4 adult grandkids. These are solidly middle class professional types, nothing fancy. Between all 3 generations of them, they had just over $70 million in assets in the USA - real estate, equities, bonds, partnerships, pension funds etc - that they liquidated and moved offshore. They are just one ordinary middle class family. What I'm saying is that it's not just big institutional investors divesting from the US that you need to worry about, it's a global sell off by managed funds comprising ""international equity"" and ""international bonds"", held by ordinary mum and dad investors. The potential returns on US bonds and  equities simply aren't worth the risk.",13
